# Practical Implementation

Practical implementation is where the power of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) becomes tangible. While understanding the theory and architecture behind MCP is important, the real value emerges when you apply these concepts to build, test, and deploy solutions that solve real-world problems. This chapter bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and hands-on development, guiding you through the process of bringing MCP-based applications to life.

Whether you are developing intelligent assistants, integrating AI into business workflows, or building custom tools for data processing, MCP provides a flexible foundation. Its language-agnostic design and official SDKs for popular programming languages make it accessible to a wide range of developers. By leveraging these SDKs, you can quickly prototype, iterate, and scale your solutions across different platforms and environments.

In the following sections, you'll find practical examples, sample code, and deployment strategies that demonstrate how to implement MCP in C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python. You'll also learn how to debug and test your MCP servers, manage APIs, and deploy solutions to the cloud using Azure. These hands-on resources are designed to accelerate your learning and help you confidently build robust, production-ready MCP applications.

## Overview

This lesson focuses on practical aspects of MCP implementation across multiple programming languages. We'll explore how to use MCP SDKs in C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python to build robust applications, debug and test MCP servers, and create reusable resources, prompts, and tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Implement MCP solutions using official SDKs in various programming languages
- Debug and test MCP servers systematically
- Create and use server features (Resources, Prompts, and Tools)
- Design effective MCP workflows for complex tasks
- Optimize MCP implementations for performance and reliability

## Official SDK Resources

The Model Context Protocol offers official SDKs for multiple languages:

- [C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk)
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk) 
- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)

## Working with MCP SDKs

This section provides practical examples of implementing MCP across multiple programming languages. You can find sample code in the `samples` directory organized by language.

### Available Samples

The repository includes [sample implementations](./samples/) in the following languages:

- [C#](./samples/csharp/README.md)
- [Java](./samples/java/containerapp/README.md)
- [TypeScript](./samples/typescript/README.md)
- [JavaScript](./samples/javascript/README.md)
- [Python](./samples/python/README.md)

Each sample demonstrates key MCP concepts and implementation patterns for that specific language and ecosystem.

## Core Server Features

MCP servers can implement any combination of these features:

### Resources

Resources provide context and data for the user or AI model to use:

- Document repositories
- Knowledge bases
- Structured data sources
- File systems

### Prompts

Prompts are templated messages and workflows for users:

- Pre-defined conversation templates
- Guided interaction patterns
- Specialized dialogue structures

### Tools

Tools are functions for the AI model to execute:

- Data processing utilities
- External API integrations
- Computational capabilities
- Search functionality

## Sample Implementations: C# Implementation

The official C# SDK repository contains several sample implementations demonstrating different aspects of MCP:

## API management

Azure API Management is a great answer to how we can secure MCP Servers. The idea is to put an Azure API Management instance in front of your MCP Server and let it handle features you're likely to want like:

- rate limiting
- token management
- monitoring
- load balancing
- security

### Azure Sample

Here's an Azure Sample doing exactly that, i.e [creating an MCP Server and securing it with Azure API Management](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-apim-functions-python).

See how the authorization flow happens in below image:

![APIM-MCP](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-apim-functions-python/blob/main/mcp-client-authorization.gif?raw=true)

In the preceding image, the following takes place:

- Authentication/Authorization takes place using Microsoft Entra.
- Azure API Management acts as a gateway and uses policies to direct and manage traffic.
- Azure Monitor logs all request for further analysis.

#### Authorization flow

Let's have a look at the authorization flow more in detail:

#### MCP authorization specification

## Deploy Remote MCP Server to Azure

Let's see if we can deploy the sample we mentioned earlier:

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-apim-functions-python.git
    cd remote-mcp-apim-functions-python
    ```

1. Register `Microsoft.App` resource provider.

   - If you are using Azure CLI, run `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App --wait`.
   - If you are using Azure PowerShell, run `Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.App`. Then run `(Get-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.App).RegistrationState` after some time to check if the registration is complete.

1. Run this [azd](https://aka.ms/azd) command to provision the api management service, function app(with code) and all other required Azure resources

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    This commands should deploy all the cloud resources on Azure

### Testing your server with MCP Inspector

1. In a **new terminal window**, install and run MCP Inspector

    ```shell
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

    You should see an interface similar to:

    ![Connect to Node inspector](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/assets/connect.png)

1. CTRL click to load the MCP Inspector web app from the URL displayed by the app (e.g. [http://127.0.0.1:6274/#resources](http://127.0.0.1:6274/#resources))
1. Set the transport type to `SSE`
1. Set the URL to your running API Management SSE endpoint displayed after `azd up` and **Connect**:

    ```shell
    https://<apim-servicename-from-azd-output>.azure-api.net/mcp/sse
    ```

1. **List Tools**.  Click on a tool and **Run Tool**.  

If all the steps have worked, you should now be connected to the MCP server and you've been able to call a tool.

## MCP servers for Azure

## Key Takeaways

- MCP SDKs provide language-specific tools for implementing robust MCP solutions

## Exercise

Design a practical MCP workflow that addresses a real-world problem in your domain:

1. Identify 3-4 tools that would be useful for solving this problem
2. Create a workflow diagram showing how these tools interact
3. Implement a basic version of one of the tools using your preferred language
4. Create a prompt template that would help the model effectively use your tool
