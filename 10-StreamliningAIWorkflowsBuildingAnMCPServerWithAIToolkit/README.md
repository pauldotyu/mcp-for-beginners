## 🎯  Overview

Welcome to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Workshop**! This comprehensive hands-on workshop combines two cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize AI application development:

- **🔗 Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard for seamless AI-tool integration
- **🛠️ AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (AITK)**: Microsoft's powerful AI development extension

### 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll master the art of building intelligent applications that bridge AI models with real-world tools and services. From automated testing to custom API integrations, you'll gain practical skills to solve complex business challenges.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is the **"USB-C for AI"** - a universal standard that connects AI models to external tools and data sources.

**✨ Key Features:**
